In this project, I used data from surveys of Star Wars fans to examine the most popular Star Wars films and characters. The data were collected by [FiveThirtyEight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/) and is available [here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/star-wars-survey).

You can find the project notebook [here](https://github.com/shelbybachman/star-wars-survey/blob/main/star-wars-survey.ipynb).
